# Learning Path

Hey there. ðŸ‘‹ This is a place where I keep all the interesting stuff I come across. Feel free to explore. It is a WIP, so you can expect things to change.

## Ideas

-   Dynamic favicon for link, inspired by [Stefan Judis](https://www.stefanjudis.com/)
-   TIR = Today I Read section / TIL
-   Get keywords from head meta to use in db
-   [x] Use git diff to update db
-   [x] Add a logger lib
-   [x] Include timezone in timestamp formats
-   Improve code snippets display with something like [expressive code](https://expressive-code.com/) or shiki plugins
-   [x] Evaluate switching to SQLite for better performance
-   Run e2e more consistently on CI, maybe in a container?
