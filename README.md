# Learning Path

Hey there. ðŸ‘‹ This is a place where I keep all the interesting stuff I come across. Feel free to explore. It is a WIP, so you can expect things to change.

## Ideas

-   Dynamic favicon for link, inspired by [Stefan Judis](https://www.stefanjudis.com/)
-   TIR = Today I Read section / TIL
-   Get keywords from head meta to use in db
-   Use git diff to update db
-   Checkout [Code hike](https://codehike.org/) for code highlighting in markdown
