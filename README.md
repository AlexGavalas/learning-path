# Learning Path

Hey there. ðŸ‘‹ This is a place where I keep all the interesting stuff I come across. Feel free to explore. It is a WIP, so you can expect things to change.

## Open issues

`Link` with hash issue after migrating to app router.

## Ideas

-   Dynamic favicon for link, inspired by [Stefan Judis](https://www.stefanjudis.com/).
-   TIR = Today I Read section / TIL.
-   Get keywords from head meta to use in db.
-   Use git diff to update db.
