### Open tasks

-   `<html>` lang is not set. Due to the fact that `_document` can't be used with `edge` runtime for some reason and configuring `i18n` in `next.config.mjs` results in a weird `500` error (related issue is [#42854](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42854)).
-   `note/[id]` pages are generated reading the filesystem. I should migrate this info to the database.
