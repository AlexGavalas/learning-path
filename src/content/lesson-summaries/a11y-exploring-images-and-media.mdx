Lesson watched on Pluralsight ([link](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/accessibility-exploring-images-media/table-of-contents)).

This lesson focused on images and media, and how to make them accessible.
The key points and the more interesting parts are summarised below.

It was also a good reminder to check the accessibility of this site and improve it where needed.
So I tried to navigate the site with a screen reader (VoiceOver on macOS) and found some small issues, mainly content announcement (eg. each link on the home page did not make much sense when it was read).
I addressed these issues and hopefully the site is easier to navigate now for screen reader users.
Now, let's dive into the summary!

## Images

They can be

-   **Decorative**. They have no purpose or no text. They are purely for background or of visual interest.
-   **Functional**. They are part of the content. They can be product images, icons etc. They contain text or infographics (eg. chart).

Describing decorative images can cause confusion on screen reader users.
We should only describe images that will help the user understand the content.
A simple test for that is to check if an image can be omitted. If yes, it is decorative.

Decorative images should have an empty `alt` attribute, no title and no role.
An empty `alt` attribute tells the screen reader that this image is decorative.
A missing `alt` attribute tells the screen reader nothing.

As a sidenote, screen reader usage "requires" the website to be navigable by keyboard.
If it is not, the screen reader user will not be able to navigate the site.

`display: none` and the `hidden` attribute hide an element from all users and screen readers.
`aria-hidden="true"` hides an element from screen readers only.

Search engine crawlers can use the `alt` text to gain more details on the site's content.
However, we must not try to exploit this by adding keywords to the `alt` text.
[Keyword stuffing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#keyword-stuffing) is a bad practice, along with some other techniques, and can get a site penalised by search engines.

The `aria-label` attribute can be used to provide a label for an element.
However, it should be used only when there is no other way to provide a label, or when the label shown makes sense only to sighted users and we have to provide some extra context for screen reader users.
Screen readers can use this in combination with the element's role to provide more information.

When the description is too long to be used as an `alt` text, we can use the [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby) attribute to point to an element that contains the description.
This element can be either shown to all users or be hidden to be used only by screen readers.
The description here has to also be to the point and include only relevant information.

## Data tables and charts

For data tables adding a [scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#scope) on the `th` elements can help screen readers understand the table's structure, and announce each table cell with the corresponding header.
A `caption` can be used to provide a summary of the table's content.
If provided, it should be the first element inside the `table` element.

For data charts, we can provide a visually hidden element with the description of the chart, along with the `alt` attribute (if applicable).
This element can be a `table` with the data displayed on the chart.
If the data displayed are too many though, having them in a `table` to be read out to the user would not be helpful.
In this case, we can summarise the data displayed and provide some key points, or whatever will make the most sense to the user.

## Audio only

Like images, we have to provide an alternative text for audio when it is not decorative.
When creating a transcript, we must be careful to include all the information that is provided by the audio.
This includes identifying each speaker, and describing any sound effects that are important to the content.

The `aria-label` attribute can be used to provide an `alt` text, and `aria-describedby` to point to a transcript.
Another way is to include a `caption` track.

## Video only

For video alternatives we can add a text and/or an audio alternative.
In both cases the information included should inlcude all the text in the video and describe what is being shown, as long as it is relevant to the content.

## Audio and video

Adding an audio description to the video, can help screen reader users understand what is happening in the video.
If the video has enough long pauses, we can add the description in these pauses.
If not, it might be easier to have two versions of the video, and allow the user to select which one to watch.

Adding captions can help users who are deaf or hard of hearing.
They are not the same as subtitles, as they have to describe anything audible that is relevant.
This includes identifying each speaker, and describing any sound effects that are important to the content.
They are written in the [WebVTT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) format.

## Color contrast

All text (except some categories) have to have at least a minimum amount of contrast ratio, depending on their usage.
We should not make assumptions on what is easier to see, and always use a tool (eg. [WebAIM's contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)) to check the contrast ratio.

## Content causing other issues

Generally we should not have audio playing automatically, as it can interfere with the user's screen reader.
It is also widely considered annoying.
If we have to, we should provide a way to pause it or control its volume.
Finally, we should not have any content that flashes more than 3 times per second, as it can cause seizures.
