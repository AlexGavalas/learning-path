# Talks

We started with a talk about websockets from [Johannes Brodwall](https://github.com/jhannes), where he explained a bit about real-time communication and gave a demo implementing it in [a small app](https://github.com/jhannes/event-sourced-websockets).

Then [Elise Kristiansen](https://frkfrontend.no) gave an insightful talk on accessibillity and how we always forget it, listing the most common a1y issues.

[Atila Fassina](https://atila.io) went on to give a brief history on some frameworks, comparing SolidJS with Tanstack Start.

[Andrey Sitnik](https://sitnik.ru/en) educated us on privacy on the web, advocating on a local first web.

Then [Radoslav Stankov](https://rstankov.com) gave us a brief overview of some of the newer CSS features, indicating that for many things there are now native solutions.

[Petter SÃ¦ther Moen](https://cv.pmoen.me) talked about React server functions and the patterns they enable in modern React apps.

[Erik Thorelli](https://github.com/esthor) went over cross platform development, updating the popular "formula" with the platform to become `UI = fn(state, platform)`.

[Erik Rasmussen](https://erikras.com) really impressed me again with his talk on React renderers. He presented a demo where with a custom React renderer he could control some smart lights with a button or even with the microphone. With a React app. ðŸ¤¯

Of course AI could not be missing in 2025, so [Lisi Linhart](https://lisilinhart.info) showed us some tools she used to re-create a 90s website, from assets and persona generation to the actual code.

Karl Lundfall (weirdly I could not find an online profile) showed us some performance optimizations they do at his company.

Finally [Vasil Dimitrov](https://github.com/vydimitrov) closed the day going over the boring fundamentals we tend to forget sometimes (e.g. request what you need from a font file, use semantic tags, do not overfetch ...).
