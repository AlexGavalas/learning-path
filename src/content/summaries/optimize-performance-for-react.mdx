What is VDOM.

## Summary of rendering in React

A React render cycle consists of two phases:

1. The `render` phase: Here React updates the current VDOM to reflect the changes in the UI, calculating the new VDOM. This is a relative cheap operation
2. The `commit` phase: The changes are applied to the DOM

> React 18 - concurrent mode - render in chunks

Before React 18, the render phase was "synchronous", meaning that when a render cycle started, it was guaranteed to finish, blocking the main thread. In React 18 this is no longer the case. The render phase can be interrupted by other tasks, such as user input or network requests. React calls this concurrent mode. In this mode, we can mark some updates as "non-urgent", allowing their render phase to be interrupted.

Add `<Demo />` here. Long list filtering? Show `startTransition` / `useTransition` / `isPending`.
`startTransition` actually re-renders the current view to set the `isPending` flag to `true`. So if the current view is expensive to re-render, we won't see a performance improvement from this change alone.

# Fixing Wasted Rendering Issues

useCallback
memo - second argument to change equality check e.g. objects
shouldComponentUpdate

Why `key` is important in lists

immutable data - do not mutate old references
e.g. do not - `delete data[id]`
do - `const clonedData = {...data}; delete clonedData[id];`
immutable libraries - immer, immutable.js
fp / pure functions mindset

# Fixing Expensive Operations

useMemo - memoize expensive operations
compute higher in the tree
List Virtualization

# Fixing Large Bundles

## Lazy Loading

React.lazy
Dynamic import

## Code Splitting
