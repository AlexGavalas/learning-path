# Frameworks

Here are some popular frameworks and libraries to check out regarding various types of testing.

## Unit

This is the simplest form of testing. Its purpose is to test individual "units" of software and validate each piece works as expected in isolation.

-   [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
-   [Vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest)
-   [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava)
-   [UVU](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu)
-   [XV](https://github.com/typicode/xv)
-   [Node Tap](https://github.com/tapjs/node-tap)
-   [Intern](https://github.com/theintern/intern)
-   [Unexpected](https://github.com/unexpectedjs/unexpected)
-   [Tape](https://github.com/ljharb/tape)

## E2E

E2E (End To End) is a software testing method that validates the entire software along with its integration with external interfaces.

-   [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) and the [cypress-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library).
-   [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)
-   [Nightwatch](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch)
-   [Taiko](https://github.com/getgauge/taiko)
-   [TestCafe](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe)
-   [QA Wolf](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf)
-   [Webdriver](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio)

## Mutation

Bugs, or "mutants", are automatically inserted into the code. The tests are run for each mutant.
If the tests fail then the mutant is killed. The higher the percentage of mutants killed, the more effective the tests are.
